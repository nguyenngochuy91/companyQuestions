#Given n balloons, indexed from 0 to n-1. Each balloon is painted with a number on
# it represented by array nums. You are asked to burst all the balloons. If the you 
# burst balloon i you will get nums[left] * nums[i] * nums[right] coins. Here left and 
# right are adjacent indices of i. After the burst, the left and right then becomes adjacent.
#
#Find the maximum coins you can collect by bursting the balloons wisely.
