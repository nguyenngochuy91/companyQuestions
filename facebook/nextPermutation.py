#31. Next Permutation
#Implement next permutation, which rearranges numbers into the lexicographically next greater permutation of numbers.
#
#If such arrangement is not possible, it must rearrange it as the lowest possible order (ie, sorted in ascending order).
#
#The replacement must be in-place and use only constant extra memory.
#
#Here are some examples. Inputs are in the left-hand column and its corresponding outputs are in the right-hand column.
