#317. Shortest Distance from All Buildings
#You want to build a house on an empty land which reaches all buildings in the shortest amount of distance. 
#You can only move up, down, left and right. You are given a 2D grid of values 0, 1 or 2, where:
#
#Each 0 marks an empty land which you can pass by freely.
#Each 1 marks a building which you cannot pass through.
#Each 2 marks an obstacle which you cannot pass through.
