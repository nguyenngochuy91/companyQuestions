#894. All Possible Full Binary Trees
#A full binary tree is a binary tree where each node has exactly 0 or 2 children.
#
#Return a list of all possible full binary trees with N nodes.  Each element of the answer
# is the root node of one possible tree.
#
#Each node of each tree in the answer must have node.val = 0.
#
#You may return the final list of trees in any order.
# Definition for a binary tree node.
