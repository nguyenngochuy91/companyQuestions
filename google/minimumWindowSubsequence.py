727. Minimum Window Subsequence

Given strings S and T, find the minimum (contiguous) substring W of S, so that T is a subsequence of W.

If there is no such window in S that covers all characters in T, return the empty string "". 
If there are multiple such minimum-length windows, return the one with the left-most starting index.
